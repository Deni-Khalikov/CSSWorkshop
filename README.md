## Back to basics

Before you can start to get all creative with shapes in CSS, one of the most important things you have to know beforehand is the difference between and the use of position: absolute and position: relative.

### Short answer:
position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parentâ€™s position and changing the layout around it.

Without any custom styling, the standard position of elements will be static. Below you can see an example:
<img src="pos-static.png" alt="Example position static" width="500px" height="">
<img src="pos-relative.png" alt="Example position relative" width="500px" height="">
<img src="pos-absolute.png" alt="Example position absolute" width="500px" height="">

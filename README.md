## Back to basics

Before you can start to get all creative with shapes in CSS, one of the most important things you have to know beforehand is the difference between and the use of position: absolute and position: relative.

### Short answer:
position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parentâ€™s position and changing the layout around it.

Without any custom styling, the standard position of elements will be static. Below you can see an example:
<img src="pos-static.png" alt="Example position static" width="500px" height="">
<img src="pos-relative.png" alt="Example position relative" width="500px" height="">
<img src="pos-absolute.png" alt="Example position absolute" width="500px" height="">

You can read [this](https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/) article if you want more information about the position property.

### CSS Shapes

You might have come across illustrations built entirely with css or visited websites that use all kinds of shapes. If they aren't images, they probably are built with CSS. Basic shapes like squares, rectangles, triangles, etc. are easy to code but if you want a reference guide for all kinds of basic shapes, you can see them here: [Shapes of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/)
